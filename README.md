Instagram Challenge
===================

This app was built as the weekend challenge for Week 8 of Makers' Academy. Due to family commitments, I had little time to work on it so didn't implement all the features I would have liked. At the moment, users can sign in and out, post pictures and edit/delete their own posts. Each user also has their own profile page displaying only their posts.

In future I may return to this project to add likes, comments and a search function.
